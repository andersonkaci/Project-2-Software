# Project-2-Software
YOLO Recognize objects from a video

# YOLO Version
YOLO 10M.pt model.  

# Training
This is a model already trained for humans, dog, and cats to great accuracy.  
It was additionally trained on drone and Pikachu datasets that we created via Roboflow.

# Multi-class Recognition
The model already came with multi-class capabilities.

# Video Proecessing
The video is separated into frames, processed, and then run through the model.  
We found videos, roughly 5-10 seconds long, online.

# Implementation
We decided to use Google Colab as the vehicle for coding. The model came from Roboflow's website in a Jupyter notebook pre-written. This made it easy to put into Colab and run there.
